# Prolog

Despite the hazards, potential that lies withing the development of individual computers are the solutions 1) to various
algorithmic problems which for example are related to the optimization of memory and CPU time management, 2) to compatibility across platforms, 3) to portability, 4) to capacity and 5) to security gaps.

The core aim of the thesis is to help the user acknowledge these possibilities and provide basic information on how to get started 

The historical analysis helps to better define the personal need in correlation to the social shifts and narrow down the derivatives for creating a satisfying system 

The thesis extensively describes the social dilemma that comes with any evolution in the digital world, analogicaly to the real world and, apart from defending the polemic of progress, it engages to cultivate a profound digital social consciousness in order to avoid misuse and benefit from the medium to its fullest potential
