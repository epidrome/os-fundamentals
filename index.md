# Prolog

Despite the hazards, potential that lies withing the development of personal computers are the solution to various algorithmic problems which for example are related to the optimization of memory and CPU time management. This can ultimately contribute to improving the products we currently use. The projects suggested for avocation [below](/projects.md) cover exactly these needs. On the one hand they are enjoyable educational materials and tools for someone who wants to study computers more deeply and on the other hand they offer minimal solutions to compatibility, portability, capacity and security gaps.

The core aim of the thesis is to help the user acknowledge these possibilities and provide basic information on how to get started. 

The historical analysis helps to better define the personal need in correlation to the social shifts and narrow down the derivatives for creating a satisfying system 

The thesis extensively describes the social dilemma that comes with any evolution in the digital world, analogicaly to the real world and, apart from defending the polemic of progress, it engages to cultivate a profound digital social consciousness in order to avoid misuse and benefit from the medium to its fullest potential.
