## Operating Systems

**MS-DOS:**  The first operating system to conquer the world of personal computers. Eleven years have passed since IBM's first PC was introduced to the world of computers, and just as much is the life of MS-DOS, its first operating system. But how strange games luck can play is shown in the case of Gary Kidall, the man who built the CP / M operating system, the PC BIOS and the boss of Digital Research. Kidall could be famous today, if at a very critical moment he was not on a surfing vacation. In fact, IBM first approached him to commission the design of the PC operating system. But because he was missing, IBM turned to Microsoft's Bill Gates. Gates bought the QDOS, a 16-bit CP / M compatible operating system, without much thought, and offered it to IBM for its first PC. From QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating System) came MS-DOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System) or PC-DOS as the PC version of IBM was called.

**Windows:** Commonly called operating system but it is not. It is the "graphic face" of DOS and has spread to most PCs in no time. Users of Amiga, Atari and Macintosh usually look at their colleagues who have a PC in a derogatory way, and perhaps rightly so: These computers have been offering "comforts" for many years, such as graphical user interface, mouse and ease of use. For some time now, however, PC users no longer need to be "ashamed" of their PC and feel disadvantaged, and with the advent of Windows 3.0, they now have about the same capabilities, albeit with some limitations. The reason is that Windows still lags behind Macintosh System 7, with the sole culprit being the operating system on which MS-DOS is based. Unfortunately for Windows, their basic functions depend on DOS, which "invisible" for the user, of course, controls them completely.

**Unix:**  It is called the "father of operating systems" and has numerous variants that can cover both small and large systems. UNIX continues to improve and signal the progress of operating systems. It has been over twenty years (in 1969 to be exact) since Ken Thompson designed the first UNIX in AT \& T Laboratories in the USA. This first edition was written by an assembler. Only when Dennis Ritchie created C did the two of them start writing UNIX in the new language, with the exception of some low-level routines that remained in assembly code. One of the primary goals in designing this operating system was to create an environment that would promote the effective development of programs. It was also important that this operating system was small and efficient in terms of the required memory space, as well as its ease of support.

**Xenix:** The story of XENIX begins in 1969, when Ken Thompson at AT \& T Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey, developed the first version of UNIX into a PDP-7, a small mini-computer. UNIX was developed when administrators, users, and developers were stunned by the complexity of large operating systems with complex task control languages. So Thompson tried to keep the system small and simple. The first versions of UNIX were for single-user systems. Although the first version of UNIX was written in symbolic language, Thompson began writing parts of the system in a programming language called B. Later Dennis Ritchie met with Thompson to develop the C programming language and rewrote most of it in the new language, ensuring one of the most important reasons for UNIX success, portability. The transfer of the system to a new CPU could be limited, to a large extent, to the registration of a C compiler for the new machine. An alternative for those who want to enter the world of UNIX is Coherent and Minix, which are quite cheap, although they have specific commercial goals. The Minix e.g. is suitable for programmers and computer science students because a large portion of the accompanying C is offered in source code. In this way the individual user can gain a good knowledge of the structure of an operating system and its basic programs. The Minix also has small hardware requirements: just 512KB of RAM and an XT hard drive. Coherent is more suitable for the ordinary user. It is a UNIX-based operating system - SVR4 and is partially compatible with source code. This means that applications of other versions of UNIX can be used, such as e.g. of SCO - Unix, while there are several written specifically for Coherent. However, Coherent 4.0 requires a 386SX computer, since it is 32-bit. Those who can afford a lot of money, such as e.g. Businesses that want to 'network' their computers should probably switch to UNIX, OS / 2 or Windows.

**OS / 2:** Described by IBM as an improved DOS and as the best of Windows. Although it is a 32-bit operating system, it does not verify the predictions regarding its wide spread. The first PC had only 16KB of memory, but for the programs of its time this memory was sufficient. But very soon 16KB became 256, 512 and finally 640. Today many computers have 4, 8, 16 or even more MB of memory. Naturally, DOS was not enough to utilize the memory of this size, and so the need arose to design an "other" category of operating system. This is at least what Microsoft and IBM should have thought in 1988 when they introduced OS / 2, which they said it would be the operating system of the 1990s. Indeed, the design of OS / 2, which many ironically called 'half OS', utilizes the protected mode of the 80286 and its descendants. In this way the user has direct access to 16KB central memory, which in the case of 80486 reaches 4GB. In addition, OS / 2 offers full Multitasking capabilities, which means that multiple programs can run at the same time.

### operation and computer components

The basic functions of any digital computer are input, storage, control, processing and output. The diagram below illustrates these activities in a simplified form.

The digital computer receives data in the form of digital signals and stores them in various main or auxiliary memory devices, until those are needed for processing. The commands that specify the functions of the computer are also stored. The control activity is related to the receipt of commands from the repository in the appropriate order and the transmission of the corresponding commands to the processor, i.e. the arithmetic / logic unit. The control also includes ensuring the communication or synchronization of the operating speeds of the various input / output modules to the corresponding processor. The processor works in a way like a calculator, adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing. However, it performs these functions at extremely high speeds. In addition, the processor has the ability to make decisions, i.e. to select and compare based on the stored information. The product (output), just like the input, takes many forms. It is generally printed on paper, placed on cards or movies, stored on secondary memory drives, displayed on the screen, or transferred to other remote devices.

A digital computer system is actually a collection of electromechanical and electronic components and devices, assembled in cases and boxes. The main memory, the controls and the arithmetic / logic unit make up the central processing unit (CPU), the heart of the system. The various input / output devices and auxiliary storage units make up the peripheral equipment. Peripheral equipment directly connected to the central processing unit is said to be in online operation mode. Correspondingly, peripheral equipment working independently of the central processing unit is said to be in an offline state.

Computer systems are equipped with a variety of programs designed to help the user perform tasks or improve system performance without unnecessarily burdening the user's current tasks. This set of programs, which is the operating system, is as important to the operation of the computer as the quality of the electromechanical equipment (hardware) itself. The operating system is usually provided by the computer manufacturer or by a software company.

During normal operation, the operating system has general, universal control over the execution of the user's individual programs. It decides when a particular program should run, as well as what to do when a particular process is terminated. In most cases, various utilities, which act as stand-alone units to facilitate the programming process, are also available within the system. This category includes translators, who convert an entire program from one programming language to another, interpreters, who execute a program in sections, translating each step, and editors, which allow writing or modifying text files, debuggers, which run a program partially, translating it or not, and oversee various situations to allow the developer to check that the program is working properly.

Translators are divided into assembler and compiler. An assembler is a translation program, which receives as input a program written in a format related to that of the machine language, called assembly language, in which each instruction step that the computer has to follow is clearly identified (but in symbolic language). The assembler translates the program into real machine language or into a format that can be perceived as such at the time the program is loaded into the computer memory to run. Instead, a compiler is a translation program that takes a program written in a higher level language and translates it into another language, usually the machine language of the computer that will run the program. To the extent that several higher level programming languages are more or less problem-oriented, there may be more than one compilation. For example, a program written in a special simulation language can first be translated into a very general programming language, which is then subjected to a second translation step, in an intermediate format, similar to the assembly language, and from there to a third stage, in machine language. Usually the user needs to know in detail only the features of the upper level language although some knowledge of the rest is usually useful in designing programs.
